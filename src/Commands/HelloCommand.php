 * a php file inside the 'Commands' directory inside your plugin directory. The file and command class should end with
 * 'Command' in order to be found by Terminus.
 *
 * To specify what the command name should be use the `@command` tag in the actual command function DocBlock.
 *
 * This command can be invoked by running `terminus hello`
